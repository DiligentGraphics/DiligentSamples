## Render State Packager

Diligent Engine allows compiling shaders from source code at run-time and using them to create pipeline states.
While simple and convenient, this approach has downsides:

- Compiling shaders at run-time is expensive. An application that uses a lot of shaders may see significant load times.
- Compiling shaders at run-time requires bundling the compiler with the engine. For Vulkan, this includes glslang, SPIRV-Tools
  and other components, which significantly increase the binary size.
- After shaders are compiled, Diligent further needs to patch them to make them compatible with the pipeline resource layout or
  resource signatures.

Pipeline state processing can be completely performed off-line using the 
[Render state packager](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderStatePackager) tool.
The tool uses the `Diligent Render State Notation`, a JSON-based render state description language. One archive
produced by the packager can contain multiple pipeline states as well as shaders and pipeline resource signatures that can
be loaded and immediately used at run-time without any overhead. Each object can also contain data for different
backends (e.g. DX12 and Vulkan), thus one archive can be used on different platforms.

Archivig pipelines off-line provides a number of benefits:

- Run-time loading overhead is reduced to minimum as no shader compilation or byte code patching is performed.
- Shader compilation tool chain can be removed from the binary to reduce its size.
- Render states are separated from the executable code that improves the code structure.
  Shaders and pipeline states can be updated without the need to rebuild the application.
- Shader compilation errors and pipeline state issues are detected at build time.

In this tutorial, we will use the render state packager to create an archive that contains all pipeline
states required to perform basic path tracing.

## Path Tracing

This tutorial implements a basic path tracing algorithm with the next event estimation (aka light source sampling).
In this section we provide some details about the rendering process. Additional information about path tracing can be easily
found on the internet. [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/)
and [Rendering Introduction Course from TU Wien University](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Rendering/VU/2021S)
could be good starting points.
[Path tracing shader source code](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples/blob/master/Tutorials/Tutorial25_StatePackager/assets/path_trace.psh)
also contains a lot of additional details.

The rendering process consists of the following three stages:

1. G-buffer generation
2. Path tracing and radiance accumulation
3. Resolve

At the first stage, the scene is rendered into a G-buffer consisting of the following render targets:

- Albedo (`RGBA8_UNORM`)
- Normal (`RGBA8_UNORM`)
- Emittance (`R11G11B10_FLOAT`)
- Depth (`R32_FLOAT`)

At the second stage, a screen-size quad is rendered that for each pixel of the G-buffer reconstructs its
world-space position, traces a light path through the scene and adds the contribution to the radiance accumulation
buffer. Each frame, a set number of new paths are traced and their contributions are accumulated. If camera moves
or light attributes change, the accumulation buffer is cleard and the process starts over.

Finally, at the third stage, the radiance in the light accumulation buffer is resolved by averaging all
light path contributions.

### Scene Representtion

For the sake of illustration, the scene in this tutorial is defined by a number of analytic shapes (boxes) and
rays are traced through the scene by computing intersections with each box and finding the closest one for each ray.
Real applications will likely use DXR/Vulkan ray tracing (see
[Tutorial 21 - Ray Tracing](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples/tree/master/Tutorials/Tutorial21_RayTracing) and 
[Tutorial 22 - Hybrid Rendering](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples/tree/master/Tutorials/Tutorial22_HybridRendering)).

A box is defined by its center, size, albedo, emissive power and type:

```hlsl
struct BoxInfo
{
    float3 Center;
    float3 Size;
    float3 Albedo;
    float3 Emittance;
    int    Type;
};
```

For the `Type` field, two values are allowed: lambertian diffuse surface and light source.

A ray is defined by its origin and normalized direction:

```hlsl
struct RayInfo
{
    float3 Origin;
    float3 Dir;
};
```

A hit point contains information about the color at the intersection, the surface normal,
the distance from the ray origin to the hit point and also the hit type (lambertian surface,
diffuse light source or none):

```hlsl
struct HitInfo
{
    float3 Albedo;
    float3 Emittance;
    float3 Normal;
    float  Distance;
    int    Type;
};

```

An intersection of the ray with the box is computed by the `IntersectAABB` function:

```hlsl
bool IntersectAABB(in    RayInfo Ray,
                   in    BoxInfo Box,
                   inout HitInfo Hit)
```

The function takes the ray information, box attributes and also the current hit point information.
If the new hit point is closer than the current one defined by the `Hit`, the struct is updated with
the new color, normal, distance and hit type.

Casting a ray though the scene consists of intersecting the ray with each box:

```hlsl
float RoomSize  = 10.0;
float WallThick = 0.05;

BoxInfo Box;
Box.Type      = HIT_TYPE_LAMBERTIAN;
Box.Emittance = float3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);

float3 Green = float3(0.1, 0.6, 0.1);
float3 Red   = float3(0.6, 0.1, 0.1);
float3 Grey  = float3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);

// Right wall
Box.Center = float3(RoomSize * 0.5 + WallThick * 0.5, 0.0, 0.0);
Box.Size   = float3(WallThick, RoomSize * 0.5, RoomSize * 0.5);
Box.Albedo = Green;
IntersectAABB(Ray, Box, Hit);

// Left wall
Box.Center = float3(-RoomSize * 0.5 - WallThick * 0.5, 0.0, 0.0);
Box.Size   = float3(WallThick, RoomSize * 0.5, RoomSize * 0.5);
Box.Albedo = Red;
IntersectAABB(Ray, Box, Hit);

// Ceiling
// ...
```


### G-buffer Rendering

The G-buffer is rendered by a full-screen render pass, where the pixel shader
performs ray casting through the scene. It starts by computing the ray starting
and end points using the inverse view-projection matrix:

```hlsl
float3 f3RayStart = ScreenToWorld(PSIn.Pos.xy, 0.0, g_Constants.f2ScreenSize, g_Constants.ViewProjInvMat);
float3 f3RayEnd   = ScreenToWorld(PSIn.Pos.xy, 1.0, g_Constants.f2ScreenSize, g_Constants.ViewProjInvMat);

RayInfo Ray;
Ray.Origin = f3RayStart; 
Ray.Dir    = normalize(f3RayEnd - f3RayStart);
```

Next, the shader casts a ray though the scene and writes the hit point properties to the G-buffer
targets:

```hlsl
PSOutput PSOut;

HitInfo Hit = IntersectScene(Ray, g_Constants.Light);

PSOut.Albedo    = float4(Hit.Albedo,   float(Hit.Type) / 255.0);
PSOut.Emittance = float4(Hit.Emittance, 0.0);
PSOut.Normal    = float4(saturate(Hit.Normal * 0.5 + 0.5), 0.0);
```

Finally, the shader computes the depth by transforming the hit point with the view-projection matrix:

```hlsl
float3 HitWorldPos = Ray.Origin + Ray.Dir * Hit.Distance;
float4 HitClipPos  = mul(float4(HitWorldPos, 1.0), g_Constants.ViewProjMat);
PSOut.Depth        = min(HitClipPos.z / HitClipPos.w, 1.0);
```


### Path Tracing

Path tracing is the core part of the rendering process and is implemented by a pixel shader
that is executed for each screen pixel. The shader starts from positions defined by the G-buffer
and traces a given number of light paths through the scene, each path performing a given number of bounces.
For each bounce, the shader traces a ray towards the light source and computes its contribution. It then selects
a random direction at the shading point using the cosine-weighted hemispherical distribution, casts
a ray in this direction and repeats the process at the new location.

The shader starts by reading the G-buffer and reconstructing the attributes of the primary camera ray:

```hlsl
HitInfo Hit0;
RayInfo Ray0;
GetPrimaryRay(uint2(PSIn.Pos.xy), Hit0, Ray0);
```

Where `PSIn.Pos.xy` are the pixel's screen coordinates.

The shader then prepares a two-dimensional hash seed that will be used for pseudo-random number generation:

```hlsl
uint2 Seed = ThreadId.xy * uint2(11417, 7801) + uint2(g_Constants.uFrameSeed1, g_Constants.uFrameSeed2);
```

This is quite important moment: the seed must be unique for each frame, each sample and every bounce to
produce a good random sequence. Bad sequences will result in slower convergence or biased result.
`g_Constants.uFrameSeed1` and `g_Constants.uFrameSeed2` are random seeds computed by the CPU for each frame.

The shader then traces a given number of light paths and accumulates their contributions. Each path starts
with the primary camera ray:

```hlsl
HitInfo Hit = Hit0;
RayInfo Ray = Ray0;

// Total contribution of this path
float3 f3PathContrib = float3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
if (g_Constants.iUseNEE != 0)
{
    // We need to add emittance from the first hit, which is like performing
    // light source sampling for the primary ray origin (aka "0-th" hit).
    f3PathContrib += Hit0.Emittance;
}

// Path throughput, or the maximum possible remaining contribution after all bounces so far.
float3 f3Throughput = float3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
for (int j = 0; j < g_Constants.iNumBounces; ++j)
{
    // ...
}
```

In the loop, the shader first samples the light source:

```hlsl
// Get uniform random variables
float2 rnd2 = hash22(Seed);
Seed += uint2(129, 1725);

LightSampleAttribs LightSample = SampleLightSource(g_Constants.Light, rnd2, f3HitPos);
```

The `SampleLightSource` function samples a random point on the light source surface and evaluates terms
required for the next event estimation. It starts by using two pseudo-random values in the [0, 1]
range produced by the `hash22` to select a random point on the light source and computing the direction
vector to this point:

```hlsl
LightSampleAttribs Sample;

Sample.f3Emittance = Light.f4Intensity.rgb * Light.f4Intensity.a;

float3 f3SamplePos = GetLightSamplePos(Light, rnd2);
Sample.f3Dir       = f3SamplePos - f3SrfPos;
float fDistToLightSqr = dot(Sample.f3Dir, Sample.f3Dir);
Sample.f3Dir /= sqrt(fDistToLightSqr);
```

Next, the function casts a shadow ray towards the selected point and computes it visibility:

```hlsl
RayInfo ShadowRay;
ShadowRay.Origin   = f3SrfPos;
ShadowRay.Dir      = Sample.f3Dir;
Sample.fVisibility = TestShadow(ShadowRay);
```

Finally, the function computes the probability density of the selected direction, which in our
case is constant and is equal to 1 over the projected solid angle spanned by the light source:

```hlsl
float  fLightArea    = (Light.f2SizeXZ.x * 2.0) * (Light.f2SizeXZ.y * 2.0);
float3 f3LightNormal = Light.f4Normal.xyz;
float  fSolidAngle   = fLightArea * max(dot(-Sample.f3Dir, f3LightNormal), 0.0) / fDistToLightSqr;

Sample.Prob = fSolidAngle > 0.0 ? 1.0 / fSolidAngle : 0.0;
```

After we get the light source sample properties, we update the path radiance as follows:

```hlsl
float NdotL = max(dot(LightSample.f3Dir, Hit.Normal), 0.0);
f3PathContrib +=
    f3Throughput                             // Ti-1
    * BRDF(Hit, -Ray.Dir, LightSample.f3Dir) // BRDF(xi, vi, li)
    * NdotL                                  // (ni, li)
    * LightSample.f3Emittance                // L(xi, li)
    * LightSample.fVisibility                // V(xi, li)
    / LightSample.Prob;                      // p(li)
```

Where:

- `f3Throughput` is the path throughput, i.e. the maximum possible remaining
  contribution after all bounces so far. Initially it is `float3(1, 1, 1)`, and
  is updated at each bounce.
- `BRDF` is the bidirectional reflectance distribution function that determines
  how much of the incoming light is reflected into the view direction. In our case, it 
  is a simple Lambertian BRDF (perfectly diffuse surface), and equals to `Hit.Albedo / PI`.
- `NdotL` aka cos(Theta) is the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the direction
  to the light source.
- `LightSample.f3Emittance` is the light source emittance.
- `LightSample.fVisibility` is the light source sample point visibility.
- `LightSample.Prob` is the probabity of selecting the direction.

After adding the light contribution, we go to the next sample by selecting a random
direction using the cosine-weighted hemispherical distribution:

```hlsl
float3 Dir;
float  Prob;
SampleBRDFDirection(Hit, rnd2, Dir, Prob);
```

`Dir` is the direction and `Prob` is its corresponding probability density.
Cosine-weighted distribution assigns more random samples near the normal direction and fewer
at the horizon, since they produce lesser contribution due to the 'N dot L' term.

We then update the throughput:

```hlsl
float CosTheta = dot(Hit.Normal, Dir);
// Ti = Ti-1 * BRDF(xi, vi, wi) * (ni, wi) / p(wi)
f3Throughput = 
    f3Throughput                // Ti-1
    * BRDF(Hit, -Ray.Dir, Dir)  // BRDF(xi, vi, wi)
    * CosTheta                  // (ni, wi)
    / Prob;                     // p(wi)
```

Finally, we trace a ray in the generated direction and update the hit properties:

```hlsl
// Trace the scene in the selected direction
Ray.Origin = f3HitPos;
Ray.Dir    = Dir;
Hit = IntersectScene(Ray, g_Constants.Light);
```

The process then repeats for the next surface sample location.

After all bounces in the path are traced, the path contribution is combined
with the total radiance:

```hlsl
f3Radiance += f3PathContrib;
```

After all samples are traced, the shader adds the total radiance to the accumulation
buffer:

```hlsl
if (g_Constants.fLastSampleCount > 0)
    f3Radiance += g_Radiance[ThreadId.xy].rgb;
g_Radiance[ThreadId.xy] = float4(f3Radiance, 0.0);
```

The `fLastSampleCount` indicates how many samples have been accumulated so far.
Zero value indicates that the shader is executed for the first time and in this
case it overwrites the previous value.

Refer to the
[shader source code](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples/blob/master/Tutorials/Tutorial25_StatePackager/assets/path_trace.psh)
for additional details.


### Resolve

Radiance accumulation buffer resolve is done in another full-screen render pass and
is pretty straightforward: it simply averages all the accumulated paths:

```hlsl
void main(in  PSInput  PSIn,
          out PSOutput PSOut)
{
    PSOut.Color = g_Radiance.Load(int3(PSIn.Pos.xy, 0)) / g_Constants.fCurrSampleCount;
}
```


## Pipeline State Packaging

The three stages of the rendering process are implemented by three pipeline states. The pipelines
are defined using the Diligent Render State Notation. They are created off-line using the render
state packager and packed into a single archive. At run-time, the archive is loaded and pipelines
are unpacked using the `IDearchiver` object.

### Diligent Render State Notation

Diligent Render State Notation (DRSN) is a JSON-based render state description language.
The DRSN file conists of the following sections:

- `Imports` sections defines other DRSN files whose objects should be imported into this one,
  pretty much the same way the `#include` directive works.
- `Defaults` section defines the default values for objects defined in the file.
- `Shaders` section contains shader descriptions.
- `RenderPasses` section defines render passes used by the pipelines.
- `ResourceSignatures` section defines pipeline resource signatures.
- `Pipelines` section contains pipeline states.

All objects in DRSN files are referenced by names that must be unique for each object
category. The names are used at run-time to unpack the states.

DRSN reflects the core structures of the engine in JSON format. For example, the G-buffer PSO is
defined in DRSN as follows:

```json
"Pipelines": [
    {
        "PSODesc": {
            "Name": "G-Buffer PSO",
            "ResourceLayout": {
                "Variables": [
                    {
                        "Name": "cbConstants",
                        "ShaderStages": "PIXEL",
                        "Type": "STATIC"
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        "GraphicsPipeline": {
            "PrimitiveTopology": "TRIANGLE_LIST",
            "RasterizerDesc": {
                "CullMode": "NONE"
            },
            "DepthStencilDesc": {
                "DepthEnable": false
            }
        },
        "pVS": {
            "Desc": {
                "Name": "Screen Triangle VS"
            },
            "FilePath": "screen_tri.vsh",
            "EntryPoint": "main"
        },
        "pPS": {
            "Desc": {
                "Name": "G-Buffer PS"
            },
            "FilePath": "g_buffer.psh",
            "EntryPoint": "main"
        }
    }
]
```

[Diligent Render State Notation](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderStatePackager#render-state-notation).


### Packager Command Line

This tutorial uses the following command line to create the archive:

```
Diligent-RenderStatePackager.exe -i RenderStates.json -r assets -s assets -o assets/StateArchive.bin --dx11 --dx12 --opengl --vulkan --metal_macos --metal_ios --print_contents
```

The command line uses the following options:

- `-i` - The input DRSN file
- `-r` - Render state notation files search directory
- `-s` - Shader search directory
- `-o` - Output archive file
- `--dx11`, `--dx12`, `--opengl`, `--vulkan`, `--metal_macos`, `--metal_ios` - device flags for which to generate
  the pipeline data. Note that devices not supported on a platform (e.g. `--metal_macos` on Windows, or `--dx11` on Linux)
  are ignored.
- `--print_contents` - Print the archive contents to the log

For the [full list of command line options](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderStatePackager#command-line-arguments),
run the packager with `-h` or `--help` option.

If you use CMake, you can define a custom command to create the archive as a build step:

```CMake
set(PSO_ARCHIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/StateArchive.bin)
set_source_files_properties(${PSO_ARCHIVE} PROPERTIES GENERATED TRUE)

set(DEVICE_FLAGS --dx11 --dx12 --opengl --vulkan --metal_macos --metal_ios)
add_custom_command(OUTPUT ${PSO_ARCHIVE} # We must use full path here!
                   COMMAND $<TARGET_FILE:Diligent-RenderStatePackager> -i RenderStates.json -r assets -s assets -o "${PSO_ARCHIVE}" ${DEVICE_FLAGS} --print_contents
                   WORKING_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
                   MAIN_DEPENDENCY "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/RenderStates.json"
                   DEPENDS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/screen_tri.vsh"
                           "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/g_buffer.psh"
                           "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/resolve.psh"
                           "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/path_trace.csh"
                           "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/structures.fxh"
                           "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/scene.fxh"
                           "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/hash.fxh"
                           "$<TARGET_FILE:Diligent-RenderStatePackager>"
                   COMMENT "Creating render state archive..."
                   VERBATIM
)
```


### Unpacking the Pipeline States

To unpack pipeline states from the archive, first create a dearciver object using the engine factory:

```cpp
RefCntAutoPtr<IDearchiver> pDearchiver;
DearchiverCreateInfo       DearchiverCI{};
m_pEngineFactory->CreateDearchiver(DearchiverCI, &pDearchiver);
```

Then read the archive data from the file and load it into the dearchiver:

```cpp
FileWrapper pArchive{"StateArchive.bin"};
auto pArchiveData = DataBlobImpl::Create();
pArchive->Read(pArchiveData);
pDearchiver->LoadArchive(pArchiveData);
```

To unpack the pipeline state from the archive, populate an instance of
`PipelineStateUnpackInfo` struct with the pipeline type and name. Also, provide
a pointer to the render device:

```cpp
PipelineStateUnpackInfo UnpackInfo;
UnpackInfo.pDevice      = m_pDevice;
UnpackInfo.PipelineType = PIPELINE_TYPE_GRAPHICS;
UnpackInfo.Name         = "Resolve PSO";
```

While most of the pipeline state parameters can be defined at build time,
some can only be specified at run-time. For instance, the swap chain format
may not be known at the archive packing time. The dearchiver gives an application
a chance to modify some of the pipeline state create properties through a special callback.
Properties that can be modified include render target and depth buffer formats, depth-stencil
state, blend state, rasterizer state. Note that properties that define the resource
layout can't be modified.
Note also that modifying properties does not affect the loading speed as no shader recompilation
or patching is necessary.

We define the callback that sets the render target formats using the `MakeCallback` helper function:

```cpp
auto ModifyResolvePSODesc = MakeCallback(
    [this](PipelineStateCreateInfo& PSODesc) {
        auto& GraphicsPSOCI    = static_cast<GraphicsPipelineStateCreateInfo&>(PSODesc);
        auto& GraphicsPipeline = GraphicsPSOCI.GraphicsPipeline;

        GraphicsPipeline.NumRenderTargets = 1;
        GraphicsPipeline.RTVFormats[0]    = m_pSwapChain->GetDesc().ColorBufferFormat;
        GraphicsPipeline.DSVFormat        = m_pSwapChain->GetDesc().DepthBufferFormat;
    });

UnpackInfo.ModifyPipelineStateCreateInfo = ModifyResolvePSODesc;
UnpackInfo.pUserData                     = ModifyResolvePSODesc;
```

Finally, we call the `UnpackPipelineState` method to create the PSO from the archive:

```cpp
pDearchiver->UnpackPipelineState(UnpackInfo, &m_pResolvePSO);
```

### Rendering

After the pipeline states are unpacked from the archive, they can be used in
a usual way. We need to create the shader resource binding objects and
initialize the variables.

To render the scene, we run each of the three stages described above. First, populate the G-buffer:

```cpp
ITextureView* ppRTVs[] = {
    m_GBuffer.pAlbedo->GetDefaultView(TEXTURE_VIEW_RENDER_TARGET),
    m_GBuffer.pNormal->GetDefaultView(TEXTURE_VIEW_RENDER_TARGET),
    m_GBuffer.pEmittance->GetDefaultView(TEXTURE_VIEW_RENDER_TARGET),
    m_GBuffer.pDepth->GetDefaultView(TEXTURE_VIEW_RENDER_TARGET)
};
m_pImmediateContext->SetRenderTargets(_countof(ppRTVs), ppRTVs, nullptr, RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);

m_pImmediateContext->CommitShaderResources(m_pGBufferSRB, RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);
m_pImmediateContext->SetPipelineState(m_pGBufferPSO);
m_pImmediateContext->Draw({3, DRAW_FLAG_VERIFY_ALL});
```

Next, perform the path tracing using the full-screen render pass:

```cpp
const Uint32 SRBIndex = m_CurrentFrameNumber & 0x01;

ITextureView* ppRTVs[] = {
    m_pRadianceAccumulationBuffer[SRBIndex]->GetDefaultView(TEXTURE_VIEW_RENDER_TARGET) //
};

m_pImmediateContext->SetRenderTargets(_countof(ppRTVs), ppRTVs, nullptr, RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);

m_pImmediateContext->CommitShaderResources(m_pPathTraceSRB[SRBIndex], RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);
m_pImmediateContext->SetPipelineState(m_pPathTracePSO);
m_pImmediateContext->Draw({3, DRAW_FLAG_VERIFY_ALL});
```

Finally, resolve radiance:

```cpp
ITextureView* ppRTVs[] = {m_pSwapChain->GetCurrentBackBufferRTV()};
m_pImmediateContext->SetRenderTargets(_countof(ppRTVs), ppRTVs, m_pSwapChain->GetDepthBufferDSV(), RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);

m_pImmediateContext->SetPipelineState(m_pResolvePSO);
m_pImmediateContext->CommitShaderResources(m_pResolveSRB[SRBIndex], RESOURCE_STATE_TRANSITION_MODE_TRANSITION);

m_pImmediateContext->Draw({3, DRAW_FLAG_VERIFY_ALL});
```


### Controlling the Application

- *Move camera*: left mouse button + WSADQE
- *Move light*:  right mouse button

You can also change the following parameters:
- *Num bounces* - the number of bounces in each path
